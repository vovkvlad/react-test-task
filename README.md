#Test Project setup

For simplicity reasons back-end and front-end leaves under one vcs root, however ideally it should
be 2 different projects.

## Back-end setup

* navigate to `./server` and execute everything listed under `README.md`

## Front-end setup

* navigate to `./client` and execute everything listed under `README.md`
